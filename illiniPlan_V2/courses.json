The range of texts we thus characterize as \"early British literature\" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the sixth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

Throughout our discussions we will think about both the \"African-ness\" and \"American-ness\" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons—philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental—and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons.

Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debates is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula."

Theory provides a vocabulary, a set of laws or generalizations, a background literature, and a conceptual framework for any effort to plan, design, and execute a research study. There is no theory-free inquiry. This is true in the social sciences as well as the natural sciences. All research seeks to explain phenomena: a theory provides an explanation for those explanations. However, these theoretical assumptions are often implicit and unreflective. Researchers may think they have no theory, or have a theory that is so taken for granted that they don’t recognize it as an assumed theory. Much of educational research suffers from this lack of theoretical self-awareness. Like any other aspect of research, theories are falsifiable. They must stand the test of evidence – which may go against them. The goal of the class is not to identify the \"right\" or \"best\" theory, but to make the identification and selection of a theory more critical and reflective. Any major theory has insights, and each has limitations."

As such, the course attends to the geographies of place and ontologies of time, i.e., moments formed from the intersection of Black social movements against white supremacy and Black reimagining of what it means to be human.

We will review rules, issues, options and resources to meet regulatory and institutional expectations (including Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). We will foster their ethical decision-making skills by discussing and analyzing real (or realistic) ethical cases. We will identify failures, justify decisions, and generate potential solutions to those errors. Same as NUTR 580."

We will cover classification and regression using these models, as well as methods needed to handle large datasets. Lastly, we will discuss deep neural networks and other methods at the forefront of machine learning. We situate the course components in the \"data science life cycle\" as part of the larger set of practices in the discovery and communication of scientific findings. The course will include lectures, readings, homework assignments, exams, and a class project. Most of the course activities will use Python with the Pandas library, which students should already be proficient using. Students will learn how to use the scikit-learn Python library for machine learning during this course. Prerequisite: Students should be familiar with the concepts of tabular data (tables) and data types (categorical, ordinal, continuous, etc.) and be able to implement these concepts in Python using Pandas. Either STAT/CS/IS 107, IS 205, INFO 407, or at least 1 semester of programming experience using Python and Pandas is recommended as a prerequisite. Students should also be comfortable with basic geometry concepts such as points, lines, and distances. Restricted to Sophomore, Junior, or Senior standing."

Theories of information can contribute to the scientific foundations for many important research and practice activities in IS, including data curation, information modeling, information access, digital preservation, and informatics support for science and scholarship. This course, Theories of Information -- A, takes a logic-based approach to investigating the nature of information. Methodologically we draw from a family of methods that might be called formal methods, in contrast to the empirical methods of social and nature science. Formal methods typically make use of concepts from logic, set theory, and discrete mathematics to construct and explore formal systems. Formal methods are widely used in linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. Within the general area of formal methods our approach in this course might be more specifically referred to as conceptual analysis, as it takes the form of a systematic analysis of a concept, namely information. Most of the prior work that is relevant to our analysis is from analytic philosophy, linguistics (especially formal semantics), and computer science (especially knowledge representation and AI). Prerequisite: Some familiarity with formal logic would be useful, but is not required. Some familiarity with conceptual modeling (ER or UML diagrams, or RDF/S for instance) would also be useful, but not required."

Content includes a systems-level overview of the central nervous system, its blood supply, and its structural and functional features, and its connection to the peripheral nervous system. The course focuses on the mechanisms by which cells create, transmit, integrate, and perceive signals to enable memory, speech, language, pain, consciousness, and mood. Neuroscience fundamentals are taught from the perspective of engineering principles that guide the development and implementation of neural technologies and enable a quantitative understanding of function through modeling. Neural engineering applications include robotics, brain and spinal cord stimulation, non-invasive brain machine interfaces, and virtual reality gamification. Neuroimaging techniques and their application for brain science, as well as the novel tools and devices used to diagnose, monitor and improve neurological function will also be discussed. Upon completion of this course, students will have an understanding of technological developments in neural engineering and a foundational understanding of neurobiology and the pathological mechanisms underlying prevalent disorders of the nervous system.

This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of analysis and interpretation of scientific data, and applications of machine learning to problems common in laboratory science such as classification and regression. There will be two 75-minute classes each week, split into discussions of core principles and hands-on exercises involving coding and data. There will be a few projects throughout semester that will build on the course material and utilize open source software and open data in physics and related fields. The list of topics will evolve, according to the interests of the class and instructors. Material will be clustered into units of varying duration, as indicated below. The lists of suggested readings and references are advisory; a large amount of material of excellent quality is now available on the worldwide web, particularly on the sites of university courses addressing the topics of each unit. A distinguishing feature of this course is its sharp focus on endeavors in the data-rich physical sciences as the arenas in which modern machine learning techniques are taught. The course uses open scientific data, open source software from data science and physics-related fields, and publicly-available information as enabling elements. Research-inspired projects are an important part of the course and students will not only execute them but will play an active role in helping define and shape them. Example projects might include machine learning approaches to searches for new particles or interactions at high-energy colliders; methods of particle tracking and reconstruction; identification, classification and measurement of astrophysical phenomena; novel approaches to medical imaging and simulation using techniques from physics and machine learning; machine learning in quantum information science. Through these projects and the course material, students will learn how large datasets in physics are generated, curated, and analyzed, using machine learning as a tool to generate key insights in both experimental and theoretical science.

Is the freer flow of trade, people, and capital around the world responsible for the world's economic, social, and political ills, or are we inclined to say that, on balance, it is still a good thing? As more people become more connected across larger distances in different ways, are they following more of the same norms and growing aware of what they share, or are they more aware of cultural differences and see integration as a threat to social cohesion? Upon completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate content expertise using both written and verbal communication skills. They will do so by: identifying the different drivers of the phenomenon widely described as globalization; distinguishing between the social, cultural, political, and economic processes of globalization and give examples of how they interact in specific and contingent ways; analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of further global integration; combining the different aspects of globalization into a coherent narrative; designing and defending their own alter-globalization campaign.
